# Moving Eyes exercise

<h2>Description</h2>

This website was created as part of the MITxEmeritus course.

This website creates a pair of eyes on the page. As the user moves the cursor around the page, the eyes "follow" the cursor.

<h2>How to Run</h2>

This project may be loaded in a browser. 

<h2>Roadmap of Future Improvements</h2>

Most of the coding for this particular project was provided by my professors in the course. I would like to continue to personalize the code and consider adding other features and flexbility to this simulation.
